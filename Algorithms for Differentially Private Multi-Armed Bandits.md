# Title: Algorithms for Differentially Private Multi-Armed Bandits

Author:Tossou and Dimitrakakis

Abstract:

1.Present DP algorithms for stochastic MAB problem(problem where private information is connected to individual rewards)

2.Prove there exists ($\epsilon$ , $\delta$) DP variants of Upper Confidence Bound(UCB) Algorithms with optimal regret O($\epsilon$^{-1}+log$\T$)

Motivation:

Privacy can be easily violated by observing changes in prediction of bandit algorithms.



Self Notes:

1.Can we find usage of bandit algorithms in mobile privacy?
