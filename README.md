# Awesome-Privacy
This is a repository for papers on all kinds of things on privacy. Currently its' only for personal use.
We're moving towards a highly connected world, where we're monitored and studied by researchers and institutes, mostly via mobile and IoT devices.
In my opinion, there're currently several things that we researchers need to pay attention to:
Mathematical Frameworks. Theoretical research in differential privacy is getting hotter, including private learning algorithms and fair learning.
Privacy in practice. Since we already have these privacy algorithms, it's important to think about how to implement them efficiently.
Domains Usage. Currently privacy is important and need to be studied in CPS systems, mobile systems and tracking systems
Policy. This part is for politics, and topics are more dynamic.
