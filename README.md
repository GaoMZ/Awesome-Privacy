# Awesome-Privacy  

This is a repository for papers on all kinds of things on privacy. Currently its' only for personal use.  
Privacy is a very interesting research area, it has promising application in interaction with learning theory, IoT, multi-agent systems.  
This is a collection of research and review papers of privacy. The papers are sorted by time. Any suggestions and pull requests are welcome.  
The sharing is only for research purpose. If any authors don't want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact me(you can find my email address on my github homepage).  
In my opinion, there're currently several things that researchers in this area need to pay attention to:   
Mathematical Frameworks(Theoretical research in differential privacy is getting hotter, including private learning algorithms and fair learning),
Privacy in practice(Since we already have these privacy algorithms, it's important to think about how to implement them efficiently),
Domains Usage(Currently privacy is important and need to be studied in CPS systems, mobile systems and tracking systems),
Policy(This part is for politics, and topics are more dynamic).
